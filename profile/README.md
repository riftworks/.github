# What is CommonRift?

**CommonRift** is a research-driven protocol and prototype exploring how to realign data collection with ethics, ownership, and emerging privacy technologies.  

Born from @johanmontorfano's thesis *“Proposition of New Ethical Procedures of Data Harvesting”*, the project investigates and proposes decentralized, consent-based infrastructures where **individuals retain full ownership over the data they generate**.

### 🎯 Our Mission

- Protect individuals from unauthorized data use
- Make data **transparent, traceable**, and **revocable**
- Enable **ethical monetization** of data with informed consent
- Replace opaque data economies with **distributed trust architectures**

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Ownership**         | Every dataset remains traceable to the individual who generated it. Ownership is enforced through cryptographic identity and smart contracts. |
| **Transparency**      | Data flows are auditable. Access and valuation processes are openly verifiable on-chain. |
| **Privacy by Design** | Utilizes T-Level identity alteration, zero-knowledge proofs, and k-anonymity mechanisms. |
| **Ethical Economy**   | Value is redistributed. A marketplace model ensures **consent-based access** and **fair compensation**. |
| **Dynamic Consent**   | Individuals can retract consent over future data usage, even post-monetization. |

## 🧪 Research-Backed Insights

📊 **788 survey respondents** (general users):  
> 85% believe their online activity is unprotected  
> 60% would switch products for better privacy  
> 90% feel uninformed about what companies do with their data  

👨‍💻 **1500 developers & tech professionals**:  
> 70% are likely to adopt ethical SaaS alternatives  
> 75% are willing to switch for better data control with API compatibility  

*Our full thesis outlines a prototype-ready model using privacy-preserving computation, user-side wallets, and blockchain-based auditability.*

## Roadmap

- [ ] Creating a Web5 system (Rift)
    > [!WARNING]
    > This Web5 system is inspired by TBD's guidelines, but goes far beyond it. For
    > this project, those guidelines and their execution are considered obsolete.
    - [ ] DWNs
    - [ ] DNS DID
    - [ ] SDK
- [ ] Adding a data-centric app to prove efficiency and make data profitable.
