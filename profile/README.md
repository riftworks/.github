# CommonRift

**CommonRift** is a protocol and research initiative dedicated to rethinking how identity and data are managed online in a hyper-decentralized way.  
It builds on academic researches and aims to provide a decentralized substrate where individuals retain verifiable control over the data they generate.

## Principles

**Identity-Centric**  
Every interaction is bound to a cryptographic peer identity. Ownership of data and services is enforced at the protocol level, with mechanisms designed to extend into decentralized identifiers (DIDs).  

**Local-First Storage**  
Applications operate on local AppSpaces that are owned by the user. Data is stored under the user’s control and only shared with explicit, verifiable consent.  

**Transparent Protocols**  
All communication occurs over auditable, open protocols built on libp2p. Request/response flows are visible to the participant, eliminating opaque data transfers.  

**Privacy as Default**  
Data exchanges are designed to minimize leakage. AppSpaces apply privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., anonymization, selective disclosure) before data ever leaves the node.  

**Consent and Revocability**  
Consent is not a one-time agreement. Users can authorize, restrict, or revoke access to their AppSpaces dynamically, ensuring long-term control.  

**Modularity**  
CommonRift provides a substrate of composable behaviours (RPC, discovery, identity, storage). Developers can extend it with new protocols without altering the foundation.  

## Research Foundations

Surveys conducted among both end-users and technical professionals highlight the demand for stronger guarantees:

- **General users (788 respondents):**  
  - 85% perceive their online activity as unprotected  
  - 60% would change products for stronger privacy safeguards  
  - 90% lack clarity on how their data is used  

- **Developers and technology professionals (1,500 respondents):**  
  - 70% are open to adopting ethically aligned SaaS solutions  
  - 75% would switch platforms if stronger data control was provided without breaking API compatibility  

These findings validate the need for consent-based infrastructures and reinforce the feasibility of adoption.

## Roadmap

1. **Development of a Web5-inspired system (Rift)**  
   *Note: This design extends beyond TBD’s Web5 guidelines, which are considered insufficient for this project’s objectives.*

2. **Prototype data-centric application**  
   - Demonstrates efficiency of the model
